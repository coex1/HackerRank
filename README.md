### About This Repository
This is a project to hone our problem solving skills by cracking at HackerRank problems.  
Goal is to solve at least 1 problem a week, and if a person fails to do so, they buy lunch.  
In this repository, we save our code, and keep each other in check via Discord webhook notification.
